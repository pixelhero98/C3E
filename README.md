# Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation

## Intro
1. The Model_box.py contains **gcn_box.py**, and **gdc_box.py** for generating C3E variants with different widths and depths.
2. The **Train_Val_Test.py** consists of the corresponding training, validation, and testing of C3E variants on various datasets (**Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, **AmazonPhoto**, **AmazonComputers**, etc).
3. The **Utility.py** has all functions for calculating the entropy of node representation, normalized Dirichlet energy, and other statistics (simply save the model and test it with test masks, and use **get_model_rep()** to retrieve the node representation). Note that for transparency, you may have to use these functions to check these metrics by running them yourself.
